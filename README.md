K-Nearest Neigbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms are implemented. 
For K-NN and SVM, you can directly run the code. For decision tree, open decision_tree.py and turn the "flag" variable to True.
For Random Forest, turn the above mentioned flag to "False" then run random_Forest.py.
